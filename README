Hell Racer - a web-based bullet hell survival game
==================================================

tl;dr: I like Touhou.

First of all I must to say that I really tried to explore everything the test
restrictions did not explicitly state (like car sizes or intended audience) in
order to bring the game closer to a genre that I actually like. So let me just
explain where the key "divergences" are:

1. Game speed (the actual criteria for increasing it was not specified)

The speed goes up 20% every 10 seconds, and not continuously over time. That
makes it more perceptible, and hopefully more exciting.

2. Impossible situations (they do not happen unless the player is bad)

I made no direct attempt to avoid any such situation. By making smaller cars
with smaller hitboxes (actually circle shapes), there is always a way out. The
player might corner him or herself, but then that would be his or her own fault.

3. Collisions (only the player collisions were explicitly demanded)

For the collisions, I decided that only the player collides because otherwise
the game would be too easy: the enemy cars would kill each other all the time.
And since the other cars do not collide, they also lack an explosion animation.

3. High score screen (it IS present upon game over)

Since the high scores are always visible, the "game over" scene is just a
freezed state between game sessions. That way the player can always check on
his or hers target record while playing. It also made things easier for me,
obviously.

4. Obstacle types (just trying to be creative)

Yeah, the cars shoot weird bullets and drop suspicious traps. The bullets revert
5 seconds of the player's time (like the hole example). The traps trigger a
"danger" event that lasts 10 seconds. During that time, the car spawn rate
increases drastically. It might even cause a real impossible situation, but then
again, it was the player's own fault for running over the trap =).
